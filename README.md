# Code for "Asymptotic inference with flexible covariate adjustment under rerandomization and stratified rerandomization"

## Data

### Abstract 

To demonstrate our theoretical results, we re-analyzed a completed cluster-randomized experiment: the Effectiveness of Group Focused Psychosocial Support for Adults Affected by Humanitarian Crises (GroupPMPlus) study.


### Availability 
The GroupPMPlus data are publicly available at https://research.repository.duke.edu/concern/datasets/kh04dq50s?locale=en.

## Code

### Abstract
The R code here can be used to reproduce all of the simulations and data applications.

### Description 
The folder `simulations` contains R code for our simulations.

 - `sim1-1.R` contains the code to reproduce Table 1 without missing outcomes of the main paper. 
 - `sim1-2.R` contains the code to reproduce Table 1 with missing outcomes of the main paper. 
 - `sim2-1.R` contains the code to reproduce Table 2 without missing outcomes of the main paper. 
 - `sim2-1.R` contains the code to reproduce Table 2 with missing outcomes of the main paper. 
 
 The folder `data-analysis` contains R code for our data applications
 
 - `data-analysis-PMPlus.R` contains the code for re-analyzing the GroupPMPlus data set.

### Reproducibility 
Tables and Figures in the main text can be reproduced using the R scripts.
